IC is an extremely simple text format designed for creating meaning. It's a simple way to collect, share, and connect our associations, perceptions, and thoughts.

IC is designed for humans first and the internet second. As opposed to HTML, which combines UI, content and application logic, IC is only for one thing: recording what someone thinks. IC's simple syntax makes it easy to uderstand for us, but it also makes it easy to build for and work with.

In IC we're connecting things. Either this goes with that, or this doesnt go with that. That's it. The syntax is basically just a `+`, a `-`, the `enter` key, and however you already talk. This makes it so literally anyone can contribute knowledge.  Here I'll show you:

```
Intelligence Collective

+ a *web* of meaning
+ a new medium
+ a new demographics
+ internet primitive
+ ponds
- streams
```

 Imagine an index.ic sitting right alongside your index.html file representing what the website owner thinks and linking to other ICs on the internet that they endorse, like a link list for perspectives.  IC files on the internet allow us to create truly decentralized and personalized knowledge webs at any scale, without having to rely on large corporations, complex search algorithms or expensive processing power.

 There is a lot to talk about. Continue here...
